# This file is used to automatically request reviews on PRs.

# Note: rd-pr should initially have no global codeowner

# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most
# precedence. When someone opens a pull request that only
# modifies files in /rd/content-nav/, only @content-nav-reviewers and not the global
# owner(s) will be requested for a review.
/rd/content-nav/    @content-nav-reviewers
