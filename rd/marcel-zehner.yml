  ## Bio
  I am a cloud and community enthusiast operating out of Switzerland. I assist customers to ensure that they understand how to master the Microsoft Azure platform and their critical workloads. I mainly focus on topics such as cloud strategy, governance, security, DevOps, and process automation. I am a community and sharing person by nature and like to share my views and knowledge about Microsoft and cross-platform technologies. That said, I love to deliver workshops and speak at conferences and events.
  Together with my team I organize my own conferences ‘Experts Live Europe’ and ‘Experts Live Switzerland’. Our goal is to bring the Microsoft community, experts, and customers together to learn, share and connect.
  Talk to me about: Azure, Cloud Strategy, Governance, Security, DevOps, Process Automation, Migration, Entrepreneurship
tagline: Governance / DevOps / Transformation
