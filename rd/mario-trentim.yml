  ## Bio
  As an Engineer, I have a passion for creativity, problem-solving, continuous improvement, and technology.
 
  Over the last +15 years, I´ve been helping organizations to build new capabilities and to realize more benefits by adopting portfolio and project management best practices.
 
  I had the pleasure to work with organizations of all shapes and sizes from different industries (Construction, Nonprofits, Retail, Banking, IT, Telecom, Oil & Gas, Aerospace, Defense, Government, and more).
 
  And I also had the privilege to work with multi-cultural teams in different regions (America, Europe, Africa, Middle East, Asia).
 
  Currently, I am the CEO at PMO Global Alliance and Executive Director at TRENTIM.com Business Solutions, a Microsoft Gold Partner company. I am also a former member at PMWB.org Board of Directors and PMIEF.org Board of Directors (2016-2018).
