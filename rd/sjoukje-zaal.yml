  ## Bio
  I’m Head of the Microsoft Cloud Center of Excellence and Head of Architecture at Capgemini in the Netherlands, a global leader in consulting, technology services and digital transformation. I have over 20 years of experience providing architecture, development, consultancy, and design expertise. I focus on Cloud, AI, and Security.

  I love to share my knowledge and I’m active in the Microsoft community as a co-founder of Lowlands.Community, and the Global XR Community. I’m the director for Global AI Community and organizer of Azure Lowlands. I’m an international speaker and involved in organizing many events. I also wrote several books and I write blogs. 

  For my community activities Microsoft awarded me with the MVP award for both Azure and AI.
