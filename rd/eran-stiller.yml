  ## Bio
  I'm an experienced technical leader with strong analytical skills and an ability to grasp
  the big picture, as well as the details it contains. I regularly make hard software 
  architecture decisions for customers, and I love presenting my work and discussing my ideas 
  with others. I thrive on technical challenges, and learning new technologies is something I 
  never stop doing.

  While technology leaders should always watch the big picture, I also love diving into the 
  code and getting my hands as dirty as possible. Azure, AWS, Kubernetes, TypeSciprt, C#, and 
  Java are among my best friends, and I flourish when I learn new ideas and tools. I firmly 
  believe that a software architect should be the best developer in their team.

  In addition to my experience in software development and architecture, I am also an avid 
  public speaker. There's almost nothing like the rush of presenting my work on stage in front 
  of a large audience. The excitement beforehand and the adrenaline during and after the session 
  are more than satisfying. With a track record of public speaking and community contribution, 
  Microsoft recognizes me as a Microsoft Regional Director (MRD) since 2018 and a Microsoft Most 
  Valuable Professional (MVP) on Microsoft Azure since 2016.

  On the Academic side, I am a graduate of the Israeli Air-Force’s prestigious “Talpiot” program. 
  I hold a B.Sc. in Computer Science, Physics and Mathematics from the Hebrew University at Jerusalem; 
  as well as an M.B.A. (with Honors) in Business Management from the Tel-Aviv University. In addition,
  I am an avid pastry chef and photographer, so if you ever need a cake or a good picture - you know
  who to call.
