  ## Spotlight
  In my work, I get the excitement of helping organizations transform their
  business by maximizing the full breadth of the latest Microsoft Cloud
  technologies.
  
  My entry to the ecosystem was over 20 years ago through my work around
  SharePoint. I am grateful for the opportunity to author the book “SharePoint
  for Project Management”, speak at industry events, and engage with the
  community to support the growth of SharePoint as mission-critical business
  platform – one that’s providing efficient collaboration, delivering business
  intelligence, managing workflows, and more.
  
  As we’ve shifted to the cloud, I’ve seen the scope of solutions that can be
  delivered with Microsoft technology expand significantly. With tools ranging
  from Power BI to Azure IoT, we’re entering into an era where cloud solutions
  can not only support the back office operations and front lines of businesses,
  but meet customer needs as well – whether it’s a custom mobile application or
  a case management system.
  
  I believe the Microsoft Cloud can be the catalyst for the digital
  transformation of every organization thanks to its ability to scale easier and
  deliver innovation faster with less resources required. I am very excited to
  continue to help organizations on the journey to digitization.
