  ## Bio
  As the founder and CEO of [Xpirit](https://www.xpirit.com/) Germany, I drive the digital, cloud and DevOps transformation for my clients in Germany.
  
  I've work for more than 20 years as a consultant and manager in the IT industry. I’m a Microsoft MVP for DevOps ever since 2015 and I love to help my customers succeed in their enterprise 
  transformation. I can build bridges between management and engineering and I can coach teams and leaders. I love the community and I believe that 
  technical communities are an important part in the modern work life. I’m one of the organizers of [Azure Meetup Stuttgart](https://azurestuttgart.de) and 
  [GitHub Stuttgart](https://www.meetup.com/GitHub-Meetup-Stuttgart/). I regularly speak and sponsor other Meetups – all over Germany.

  I'm the author of the book [Git for Dummies (German)](https://www.amazon.com/-/de/dp-3527716971/dp/3527716971/) and I'm writing my next book about DevOps with GitHub. 
  
  My passion is sharing knowledge through public speaking, writing and mentoring. I’m a regular speaker at international conferences and I speak in English, 
  German, and Spanish. I’ve published several articles in magazines and I regularly blog at [writeabout.net](https://writeabout.net/).
  Talk to me about DevOps, GitHub, DevSecOps, Azure, AWS, .NET, Clean Code, Scrum and Kanban
