  ## Bio
  CEO and lead solution architect of CITUS, a software development company with a focus on new innovative products that utilize AI (Deep Learning, Cognitive Services, etc.), Mixed Reality, and Office/Microsoft 365 & Azure. Together with my team, I have won more than 80 international awards for innovation in our IT products all around the world, based on my 5 patents. 

  I have helped a lot of SMEs and large enterprise corporations, government organizations, and K12, and high-level education institutions in their digital transformation journey.
  As a trusted advisor for Croatian institutions, I am participating in efforts to create national and EU strategies in the field of AI, IoT, Cyber Security, and Cloud Computing. 

  As a Business Development Consultant, in the past 20 years, I have helped to found 10 Microsoft Innovation Centers in Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, North Macedonia, Kosovo, Moldova, Georgia, Armenia and helped to create several National ICT Strategies. 

  I am a speaker at a number of IT, scientific and business conferences, Ph.D. candidate and lecturer at University College, author of IT-related scientific papers, and mentor to many students, MS Community members, and MVP candidates ðŸ˜Š. I have delivered many workshops from the Silicon Valley, Europe to Asia about different technologies both from architecture and deep technical point of view. 
  I have been one of the founders of the Microsoft Community in Croatia and, as a Microsoft Regional Director and INETA Europe, VP for Communities (both more than 10 years in a row) helped to found a number of Microsoft Communities in Central & Eastern Europe. I am Microsoft Most Valuable Professional 17 years in a row, based on my recognized expertise and community work, including mentoring other speakers, Community Champs, today active MVPâ€™s, and some of the Regional Directors that are part of the current RD program.
