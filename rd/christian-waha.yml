  ## Bio
  Since many years I work with Microsoft Technologies. I started developing many years ago with Visual Basic 3.0 some C and C++ over the years I developed so much stuff in .NET C#, F# and now with my new favorite Q#. I had many talks about using WPF, WCF, HoloLens and especially Azure IoT. In the last 10 years I worked for most of the telecommunication companies in Germany, I was also responsible to build up an IoT Platform for one of the leading companies in Europe.

  Now I work as Technical Fellow and support our company and our customers on their journey to digitalize them. This can be Cloud Computing, Modern Workplace, Agile Structures or working with fancy technologies like HoloLens. 

  I founded many Meetups like, Windows Insider Meetup Germany, HoloLens Meetup Germany and Azure Meetup Munich. Since many years I speak on my meetups and user groups and help others to speak in front of people. Since Corona restricted our ability to speak in front of a real audience, more and more goes virtual. I am also Linkedin Instructor and have there some courses. You will find me for sure on one of the next major conferences in Europe. 
 
  So keep in touch and letâ€™s talk about Azure, Cloud Computing, Cloud Governence, MS365 Development or Quantum Computing]
